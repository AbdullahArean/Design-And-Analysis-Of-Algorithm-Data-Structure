### Title:
### Prim’s and Kruskal’s Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree Analysis 
### Abstract:
Prim’s Algorithm and Kruskal’s Algorithm are two of the most common minimum spanning tree finder algorithms used in computer science. Both of these algorithms are tested on different implementations and different datasets to determine their effectiveness. Extensive research has been conducted to determine which of the two algorithms is best for a given problem. This has led to the development of other algorithms that are better suited for a specific type of data or a specific type of problem.
### Introduction:
The prim’s algorithm starts by choosing the root vertex and then moves through nearby vertex pairs. By starting with the shortest weighted edge, Krushal's approach, on the other hand, assists in creating the minimal spanning tree. 
Popularly known as a greedy method, Prim's approach aids in locating the lowest spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph. This means that the total weight of all the edges in the tree should be as low as possible because this method likes to explore the subgroup of edges that may create a tree.
In the field of computer science, the shortest spanning tree of a connected graph and the spanning forest of an undirected edge-weighted graph are both found using Kruskal's Algorithm. Essentially, it takes a graph as input and finds the subgroup of its edges.
